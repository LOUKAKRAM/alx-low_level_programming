# ALX School C Programming Tasks

This directory contains a series of C programming tasks assigned by ALX School. Each task is described below, along with the scripts and C programs to complete them:

## Task 0: 0-preprocessor
- **Script**: `0-preprocessor`
- **Description**: This script runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file. The C file name is stored in the variable `$CFILE`, and the output is saved in a file named `c`.

## Task 1: 1-compiler
- **Script**: `1-compiler`
- **Description**: This script compiles a C file but does not link it. The C file name is stored in the variable `$CFILE`, and the output file is named the same as the C file but with the extension `.o` instead of `.c`.

## Task 2: 2-assembler
- **Script**: `2-assembler`
- **Description**: This script generates the assembly code of a C file and saves it in an output file. The C file name is stored in the variable `$CFILE`, and the output file is named the same as the C file but with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`.

## Task 3: 3-name
- **Script**: `3-name`
- **Description**: This script compiles a C file and creates an executable named "cisfun." The C file name is stored in the variable `$CFILE`.

## Task 4: 4-puts.c
- **C Program**: `4-puts.c`
- **Description**: A C program that prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle," followed by a new line, using the `puts` function. The program ends with the value 0.

## Task 5: 5-printf.c
- **C Program**: `5-printf.c`
- **Description**: A C program that prints "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," followed by a new line, using the `printf` function. The program returns 0 and compiles without warnings using the `-Wall` gcc option.

## Task 6: 6-size.c
- **C Program**: `6-size.c`
- **Description**: A C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. The program should produce the exact same output as in the provided example. Warnings are allowed, and the program returns 0.

## Task 7: 100-intel
- **Script**: `100-intel`
- **Description**: This script generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C file and saves it in an output file. The C file name is stored in the variable `$CFILE`, and the output file is named the same as the C file but with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`.

## Task 8: 101-quote.c
- **C Program**: `101-quote.c`
- **Description**: A C program that prints "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, to the standard error. The program returns 1 and compiles without any warnings using the `-Wall` gcc option.
