/**0x01-variables_if_else_while* is a  directory contains a series of C programming tasks that focus on variables, if statements, else clauses, and while loops. These tasks are designed to help you practice and understand these fundamental concepts in C programming. Below is a brief description of each file within the directory:

#0-positive_or_negative.c

Description: This program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and prints whether the number stored in n is positive, negative, or zero.
#1-last_digit.c

Description: This program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number stored in n.
#2-print_alphabet.c

Description: This program prints the lowercase alphabet in C, using only the putchar function and keeping all the code within the main function.
#3-print_alphabets.c

Description: This program prints the lowercase and uppercase alphabet in C, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function.
#4-print_alphabt.c

Description: This program prints the lowercase alphabet in C, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e,' using only the putchar function and keeping all the code within the main function.
#5-print_numbers.c

Description: This program prints all single-digit numbers in base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function.
#6-print_numberz.c

Description: This program prints all single-digit numbers in base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. It has the additional constraint of not using any variable of type char and using the putchar function with limited usage.
#7-print_tebahpla.c

Description: This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse (from 'z' to 'a') in C, using only the putchar function and keeping all the code within the main function.
#8-print_base16.c

Description: This program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the putchar function and with a limited number of putchar calls.
#9-print_comb.c

Description: This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers separated by commas and spaces, in ascending order, using only the putchar function.
#100-print_comb3.c

Description: This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits in ascending order, with the two digits separated by commas and spaces. It avoids repetitions like "01" and "10" and uses the putchar function with a limit on the number of putchar calls.
#101-print_comb4.c

Description: This program prints all possible different combinations of three digits in ascending order, with the three digits separated by commas and spaces. It avoids repetitions and uses the putchar function with a limit on the number of putchar calls.
#102-print_comb5.c

Description: This program prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers in ascending order, with the numbers separated by a space and formatted to have two digits. It uses the putchar function with a limit on the number of putchar calls.
